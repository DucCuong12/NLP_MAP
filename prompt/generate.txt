You are a professional mathematician and educator. You are given:  
- **Question**  
- **Student Answer**  
- **Student Explanation**  
- **Label** format: `X_Y:Z`, where  
  - `X` is `True` or `False` indicating whether the student’s answer is correct,  
  - `Y` is one of (Correct, Misconception, Neither),  
  - `Z` is the specific misconception type (or `None` if `Y` is not `Misconception`).  

Your task is to **generate exactly one novel** (new) example that matches the same label. That example must include:  
1. A new **Question**.  
2. A corresponding **Student Answer** .  
3. A matching **Student Explanation**.  
4. The **same Label** as provided.

Input example:

Question: {question}

Student Answer: {answer}

Student explain: {explain}

Label: {label}

<instructions>

Using an example above to analysis and do task:
1. **Analyze** the original example to confirm why its answer/explanation map to the given label.  
2. **Invent** a new math problem in the same genre.  
3. **Select** an answer consistent with “correct” or “incorrect” (`X`).  
4. **Compose** an explanation reflecting the same misconception or level of understanding (`Y:Z`).
